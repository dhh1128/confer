# confer

[![CI](https://github.com/dhh1128/confer/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dhh1128/confer/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An MCP-mediated channel that lets AI coding agents notify the user on their phone (via Discord DM) when a long-running task finishes or input is needed, and receive a dictated reply.

## Quick start

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — install with `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

From a fresh clone:

```bash
uv sync          # creates .venv, installs confer (editable) + dev dependencies
uv run pytest    # runs the test suite with branch coverage (target: 100%)
```

## Where things live

- [`this.i`](this.i) — source of truth for *why* design decisions were made (read this first if you want to understand the project).
- [`docs/methodology.md`](docs/methodology.md) — the intent-driven development discipline in force here.
- [`docs/intent-briefing.md`](docs/intent-briefing.md) — long-form reference for `this.i` format and the broader Intent Layer model.
- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — ground rules for AI assistants working in this repo.

## Status

Pre-implementation. The intent tree is in place; the MCP server itself is not yet built.
